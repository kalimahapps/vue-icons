# Developer Guide
- Run `pnpm check-updates` to see if there are any repo updates
- Run `pnpm update-submodules` to update submodules (icon fonts packages)
- Run `pnpm build-icons` to build icons

## Testing
- Run `pnpm test` to run all tests
- Run vitest with `-u` to update snapshots
- icons-list.json is generated by tests. It is used to check if icons are missing or added. Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can run remove it and run `pnpm test` again to regenerate the file. This will ensure that the file is up to date with the latest icons.
